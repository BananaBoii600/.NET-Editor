Dot Net Editor is an VB/C# text editor with the ability to run code and code snippets. It can run a complete code file, or a snippet containing only the inside of a class or the inside of `Main()`.

The program does not use an interactive console when Console.ReadLine is executed. Instead the text in “Input Data” is used as the input.
The input is relayed into the Console output to simulate an interactive console.
This can help users (likely students and educators) to verify the correctness of the program.
